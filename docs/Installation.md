Here is an [uncopylocked game](https://www.roblox.com/games/12427031634/InfiniteMath-Demonstration) that uses InfiniteMath, its a simple idle game but it gets the point across, and here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2ReZtRgCmw) showing off that game.

Here's the [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/infinitemath-go-above-103081e308/2182434) post.

If you use InfiniteMath in your game, send it to me on Discord `Kdude#1774` and I'll add it to the DevForum post!
