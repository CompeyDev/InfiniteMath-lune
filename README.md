InfiniteMath is a module that allows you to surpass the double-precision floating-point number limit of `10^308`.

Here's the [installation](https://kdudedev.github.io/InfiniteMath/docs/Installation) page, an in-depth [explanation](https://kdudedev.github.io/InfiniteMath/docs/Explanation) of the module, and API [documentation](https://kdudedev.github.io/InfiniteMath/api/InfiniteMath).

Here's the [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/infinitemath-go-above-103081e308/2182434) post of the module. If you use InfiniteMath in your game, send it to me on Discord `Kdude#1774` or reply to the post with your game and I'll add it to the DevForum post!

Here is an [uncopylocked game](https://www.roblox.com/games/12427031634/InfiniteMath-Demonstration) that uses InfiniteMath. It's a simple idle game but it gets the point across, and here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2ReZtRgCmw) showing off that game.
